# Supply Chain Traceability for Ethical Sourcing

## Overview

This platform leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, verifiable system for ethical sourcing throughout the supply chain. By implementing smart contracts for supplier verification, material tracking, labor certification, and consumer verification, we enable businesses to validate ethical claims while empowering consumers to make informed purchasing decisions.

## Key Components

### Supplier Verification Contract
Validates compliance with ethical standards:
- Ethical policy documentation
- Third-party certification verification
- Environmental compliance tracking
- Sustainability commitment monitoring
- Regular audit validation

### Material Tracking Contract
Monitors components throughout the production process:
- Raw material source verification
- Processing and transformation logging
- Component assembly tracking
- Batch and lot traceability
- Chain of custody documentation

### Labor Certification Contract
Verifies fair labor practices across the supply chain:
- Worker rights verification
- Fair wage confirmation
- Safe working conditions documentation
- Anti-discrimination policy adherence
- Child labor prevention measures

### Consumer Verification Contract
Allows end users to confirm ethical claims about products:
- QR code/NFC verification interface
- Product journey visualization
- Certification display and validation
- Impact metrics presentation
- Consumer feedback mechanisms

## Benefits
